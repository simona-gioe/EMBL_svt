# EMBL_svt

This repository contains a collection of scripts supporting image and data analysis for my PhD work in the Aulehla Group at EMBL Heidelberg. Aside from the [image concatenation script](https://github.com/simona-gioe/EMBL_svt/blob/main/concatenate/Concatenate_Images.py), which was written and developed by Aliaksandr Halavatyi as part of a previous project, all other scripts in this repository were developed by me, and used to analyse data extracted from imaging datasets of mouse intact presomitic mesoderm. The results of this work will be available [here](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/37071/) from July 30th 2026.

## Timeseries concatenation

The [Concatenate_Images.py](https://github.com/simona-gioe/EMBL_svt/blob/main/concatenate/Concatenate_Images.py) script was written by Aliaksandr Halavatyi to concatenate multi-position live imaging timeseries.
